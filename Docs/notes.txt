Section 1 - Front-End Web Development:
	How does the internet work?
		Client -> ISP -> Domain Name System (DNS) -> Server

	How do websites actually work?
		HTML - website content (bricks in a house)
		CSS - website style (painting)
		JS - website functionality (electricity system, cooker, doors)
		
	How to get the most out of the course:
		1. Watch the tutorial. 
		2. Instead of coding along, try to understand everything that is happening in the tutorial. 
		3. Take notes.
		4. Then code-along.

		A) Topic/Title
		B) Keywords/Questions
		C) Notes

Section 2 - Introduction to HTML
	Hyper Text Markup Language; Hyper Texts are keywords inside a document that takes you to another document. 
	
	Basic HTML elements: 
		Heading Elements: <h1><h1/> to <h6><h6/>
		Paragraph Elements: <p><p/>
		Void Tags: 
			<hr/>: Horizontal Rule (line)
			<br/>: Break (Ends a line in a paragraph)
			Can also be used without closing tag, but it is not recommended. <hr>, <br>

Section 3 - Intermediate HTML
	List Element:
		Unordered: (Order does'nt matter)
			<ul>
				<li>List Item</li>
				<li>List Item</li>
				<li>List Item</li>
			</ul>
		Ordered: (Order matters)
			<ol>
				<li>1st - List Item</li>
				<li>2nd - List Item</li>
				<li>3rd - List Item</li>
			</ol>
	Nesting and Indentation:
		(LITERALLY LOOK AT THE STRUCTURE OF THIS NOTE)
	Anchor Elements: (Literally Links)
		<tag attribute=value>Content</tag>, in the case of an anchor tag:
			<a href="www.google.com">Search Google Here</a>
		
		Other attributes:
		<a draggable=true>Drag This</a>
	Image Element:
		<img src="image source" alt="Alternative title in case image doesnt load"/>
		For image source you can add the path to the image (including the name) or you can use a link.
